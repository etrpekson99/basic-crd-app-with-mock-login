This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Notes
- Decided against adding validation for branch ID, username, and password since it is a security standart to not display detailed error messages during the log in
- Made use of vitest over Jest as it is more lightweight
- Made use of Zustand instead of Redux since it is also more lightweight and has less boilerplate code, while maintaining the ease of use that isn't usually offered by using local storage or context
